# `gclv` - `golangci-lint` version manager

This is a version manager for [`golangci-lint`][golangci-lint]. It works similar
to `pyenv` or `rvm` where you manage multiple binaries through `gclv`.

## Usage

There are two ways to select `golangci-lint` version with `gclv`. For other
available commands and usage, use `gclv --help`.

### Manually

Just specify the version you want to use. If it does not exist locally it will
be downloaded. If it exists it will be re-linked. If it's already selected,
nothing will happen.

```sh
$ gclv --select v1.42.0                                                                                                                                                      130 â†µ

```

### With `golangci-lint` configuration

Since `golangci-lint` doesn't care about unknown configuration you can specify
what version you want to use in your [`.golangci.yml`][golangic-lint-config] and
`gclv` will be able to pick that up.

All you need to do is to add the key `golangci-lint-version` to your existing
configuration file. There are two files in the `examples` directory that can be
used to test this.

```sh
$ cd examples
$ config=golangci-1.40.yml

$ gclv $config
Switching to v1.40.0

$ golangci-lint --version
golangci-lint has version 1.40.0 built from 5c6adb63 on 2021-05-10T10:45:21Z

$ golangci-lint run --config $config
